Routing => Navigation between screens

Module => react-navigation

react-native-navigation
	StackNavigator
	TabNavigator
	
StackNavigator
	var routes = {
		Login: {
			screen: LoginScreen
		},
		Home: {
			screen: HomeScreen
		}
	}
	
	var routeOptions = {
		initialRouteName: 'NB'
	}
	
	const NavigationInstance = StackNavigator(routes, routeOptions);
	
By Default all components that are configured to StackNavigator will receive navigation object as in input. In this we need to use helper method navigate to change the screen.
	this.props.navigation.navigate(route, params?)
	
	this.props.navigation.navigate('Home')
	
	this.props.navigation.navigate('Home', { userName: 'Karthik'})
